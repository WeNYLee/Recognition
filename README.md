A repo that tries methods for recognizing texts and removing texts gracefully, where

1. Recognition:
(a) comic_demo.ipynb: shows how to recognize texts.

2. Removing Texts Gracefully:
(a) generate_inputs.ipynb: shows how to generate images without texts (leaving some holes) and create associated masks.
(b) generative_image_inpainting.ipynb: use outputs from generate_inputs.ipynb to fill in the "holes" of the images.
